# RTS-Mechanics-Unity
With focus on my core mechanic of RTS Unit Management, my goal is to create a mechanic similar to StarCraft 2 and WarCraft 3. 

The mechanic in SC2 functions the following way.
You can select units through mouse click or creating a selection box holding the mouse button. Then you can control the selected
units making them move or hold position. Also, it's possible to create control groups, which allow you to save a group of units, 
and either access them through a hotkey or going to their location. To finalize, you can also queue actions by ordering 
them while holding down shift. All of this has already been coded. 

In the future, I plan to do melee and ranged combat, enemy and ally units, types of units, structures, and structure building.
